SUMMARY:Writing English
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Kristen  Dedeaux (Kristen Dedeaux Consulting ).
  So you know Java, Scala, Python, and Perl, but do you know the correct 
 usage of a semicolon when it comes to the English language? Writers and 
 engineers alike often fall victim to grammatical blunders that can obscu
 re their intended message. Fortunately, there are some simple ways of sp
 otting and correcting these errors. Once learned, your writing will impr
 ove and your readers will thank you.

SUMMARY:Unicorns, Dragons, Open Source Business Models And Other Mythica
 l Creatures
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Andrew Clay Shafer (Pivotal). No one size fits 
 all formula can be applied to build a business around open source, and a
 ttempting to do so may end in humiliation and disaster. There is no doub
 t that 'Open Source' has impacted the dynamics of all manner of business
 , but building a business on 'Open Source' is not a solved problem. A gu
 ided tour of open source business models, real and imaginary.

SUMMARY:How Instagram.com Works
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Pete Hunt (Facebook / Instagram). Instagram.com
  renders almost all of its UI in JavaScript. I'll talk about how our pac
 kaging and push systems work in great detail, which are clever combinati
 ons of existing open-source tools. Anyone building a large site using lo
 ts of JavaScript would find what we've learned interesting!

DESCRIPTION:Presented by VM Brasseur (shoeless consulting). Hiring remot
 e workers is great for filling those holes on the team...but if you don'
 t have the correct infrastructure in place you're just setting yourself-
 -and your team members--up for a world of hurt. This session will detail
  how our engineering department went remote and thrived because of it.

SUMMARY:Build Your Own Exobrain
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Paul Fenwick (Perl Training Australia). Online 
 services like "If This Then That" (IFTTT) are great for automating your 
 life. However they provide limited ways for the end-user to add their ow
 n services, and often require credentials that one may normally wish to 
 keep secret. The 'exobrain' project allows for service integration and e
 xtension on a machine *you* control.

SUMMARY:Rebooting Open Source at Facebook
DESCRIPTION:Presented by James Pearce (Facebook). Open source has always
  been a huge part of Facebook's culture. But in 2013, we rebooted our po
 rtfolio and launched a unique suite of internal tools & instrumentation 
 to support hundreds of repos, thousands of engineers, and tens of thousa
 nds of contributors. The result? Better-than-ever community adoption - a
 nd an open & responsible stewardship, attuned to our ethos of hacking & 
 moving fast.

SUMMARY:Contributing to Contributors: Breaking Down the Barriers to Firs
 t-commit
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Steve Heffernan (Brightcove, Video.js). Every o
 pen source project is a unique snowflake of technology choices, coding s
 tyle, and communication channels. Learning not only how, but the "correc
 t" way to contribute to each new project can be a blocker for would-be c
 ontributors. This talk will give practical examples of how you can reduc
 e the learning curve for new contributors and improve the quality of fir
 st-commits.

DESCRIPTION:Presented by Trisha Gee (MongoDB). It seems to have been a c
 ommon theme amongst startups to create the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) 
 in a language that facilitates rapid prototyping (for example Ruby), and
  then migrate to the JVM when the application has proved itself and requ
 ires more in terms of stability and performance.

SUMMARY:From Cloud to Fog Computing and the Internet of Things
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Michael Enescu (Cisco). Open Source is ubiquito
 us in Cloud compute.  Just as we became familiar with Cloud computing, a
  new model has emerged, an extension of the cloud to the edge of the net
 work, some call it Fog computing, some call it the Internet of Things.  
 This talk describes how the compute model is changing as the new generat
 ion of devices stretched what we previously knew as Cloud compute.

SUMMARY:Just My Type
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Piers Cawley (Thermeon). We perl programmers ar
 en't known as fans of formal types. Types are for straitjacketed languag
 es like Java. But... the Moose revolution's changing all that. Types are
  a great way of encapsulating the messy business of data conversion and 
 parameter validation, and can help you think more clearly about what's g
 oing on in complex code.

SUMMARY:Testing with Test::Class::Moose
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Curtis Poe (All Around The World). Perl is know
 n for its testing culture. Unfortunately it's often focused on quantity 
 over quality. Perl's Test::Class::Moose project started out as an experi
 ment but morphed into a way of having higher quality testing. With this 
 module, you can get fine-grained control over your test suite, better un
 derstand your *real* code coverage and get an quick boost to test suite 
 performance.

SUMMARY:Highly Functional Programming in Perl
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Eric Wilhelm (Cisco, Inc.). Functional programm
 ing is everywhere, hiding between imperative procedures.  Stateless code
  with no side-effects may seem academic, but practical application of fu
 nctional techniques leads to fewer bugs and cleaner code.  Functional th
 inking is useful whether you're wrestling with a mess of copy-pasta or d
 oing test-first development on some new object library.

SUMMARY:Python: Encapsulation with Descriptors
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Luciano Ramalho (Python.pro.br). Python has no 
 private fields, but the property decorator lets you replace public attri
 butes with getters and setters without breaking client code. And the des
 criptor mechanism, used in Django for model field declarations, enables 
 wide reuse of getter/setter logic via composition instead of inheritance
 . This talk explains how properties and descriptors work by refactoring 
 a practical example.

 ce a common question: are Linux Containers secure enough? It is often cl
 aimed that containers have weaker isolation than virtual machines. We wi

SUMMARY:Monitoring Distributed Systems in Real-time with Riemann and Cas
 sandra
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Patricia Gorla (The Last Pickle). Computing is 
 spreading outwards: clusters of 1000s of nodes serve a single database, 
 and hundreds of machines analyze the same KPIs. How do we monitor a clus
 ter with many nodes? This talk presents how to effectively monitor a mul
 ti-node Cassandra cluster using Riemann and other graphing solutions.

SUMMARY:You Don't Know How Your Computer Works
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Matthew Garrett (Nebula). Software development 
 is easy. You tell a computer to do something. It does it. Someone sends 
 you a packet. The OS receives it. Things don't happen unless you ask the
 m to. Simple. But what if that wasn't true? What if your computer is ful
 l of hidden magic? What if your hardware makes assumptions about your so
 ftware? Vendors wouldn't do that, would they? (Spoiler: Yes, they would)

SUMMARY:Design for Life
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Juhan Sonin (Involution Studios). It's time to 
 design products to capture life and physiologic signs invisibly… usually
  through non-invasive sensors that don't require a single drop of blood,
  but just whiffs and sniffs. And when it is visible, it must be designed
  to feel wonderful.

SUMMARY:The Case for Haskell
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Alejandro Cabrera (Rackspace Hosting Inc.). We'
 re building ever larger and more complex systems. Coupled with changing 
 requirements and demands for scaling concurrency and parallelism, taming
  this complexity is no small order. Allow me to share my excitement with
  you! I'll show you how Haskell helps tame this complexity, allows you t
 o overcome the challenges of modern software, and make predictions about
  what the near future holds.
